# ForgetmeNot3
Yet another refactor, changing state model to save size

## Rules

New game starts with longpress of center tile. Also a special case where a new game will autostart when 6 tiles are arranged around a center piece 
after fresh download or powerup. 

Once flower blooms (center turns yellow with sparkles) then you press center to start round.  A puzzle is presented for you to memorize. 
When the countdown clock  expires, the everything goes dark for a pause and then returns… but with one petal different. Click on the one you
think changed. If you see a green sparkle then you picked right, and will return to the blooming flower to start the next round. If you pick wrong,
everything turns red except for the tile you should have picked which is green, and then you see the scoreboard (described below). Longpress the center to
start a new game. If you get though all 72 levels correctly, then you see a lavish celebration display – longpress the center tile to start a new game.

If you successfully get though all 72 levels then you see a spellbindly beatiful flurish. Longpress to start a new game. 

### Scroeboard

Scorebord spins around the permitier of the tiles indicating how many levels you completed. 18 levels per spin (one for each permiter edge), and each time 
around the color changes so you can see how many full rotations.
