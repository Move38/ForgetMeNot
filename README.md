# ForgetmeNot

## Rules

Ready to play when 6 tiles are arranged around a center piece. 

Once flower blooms (center turns yellow with sparkles) then you press center to start round.  A puzzle is presented for you to memorize. 
When the countdown clock  expires, the everything goes dark for a pause and then returns… but with one petal different. Click on the one you
think changed. If you see a green celebration then you picked right, and will return to the blooming flower to start the next round. If you pick wrong,
everything turns red except for the tile you should have picked which is green, and then you see which level you achieved on the scoreboard (described below). Click the center piece to start a new game. If you get though all 72 levels correctly, you will be rewarded with a lavish celebration – click to then be treated to a bonus alternate universe of 72 levels.

### Reset
Triple click the center tile at any time to reset and start a new game.

### Scoreboard

Scorebord spins around the permitier of the tiles indicating how many levels you completed. 18 levels per spin (one for each permiter edge), and each time 
around the color changes so you can see how many full rotations.
